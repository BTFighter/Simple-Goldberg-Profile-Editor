A verrrrry simple Goldberg Emu profile editor that does the ff:

- Change Account Avatar
- Change Username
- Change Language
- Change "settings" location (for users that use local_save or prefer to use other locations other than GSE Saves)

This modifies config.user.ini and account_avatar in the default location (%appdata%/GSE Saves/settings) but you can change this in the editor.

Made using WinForms (.NET Framework) 4.7.2.
